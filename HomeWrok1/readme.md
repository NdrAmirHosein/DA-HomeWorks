# These are two algorithmic problems

## Here are the questions:

1- Design an algorithm that finds the longest path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in 
linear time.


2- You are given a wooden stick of length L, and you are only allowed to cut it into pieces of 
lengths from the set:

{1, l, l², l³, …}, where l ≥ 2 is a fixed integer.

Design an algorithm that cuts the stick into the minimum number of pieces using only 
the allowed lengths.



I tried to solve them and code in C++
First it was so challenging but finally did it.

That's a great move for the first step coding with C++.
